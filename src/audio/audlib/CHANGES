October 1998
-------------

5   Started work on AUDlib.  Very fuzzy!
6   Implemented more efficient method: a chunk at a time.
8   Got the right sound today, no fuzz.
9   Fixed restart_aud().
10  Cleaned up; more library like.
    Wrote doc.
11  Added set_aud_volume().
    Made get_next_chunk() and get_next_code() inline.
    Version 0.5 [BETA] released.


November 1998
--------------

xx  unload_aud() is automatically called after aud has finished playing and 
    aud_loaded is set to FALSE.
29  Prevented AUDlib from constantly calling malloc/realloc.
    Tried to do a Windows port with RSXNTDJ, very choppy.


December 1998
--------------

19  Removed RSXNTDJ stuff.


January 1999
-------------

9   Reverted to 0.5 release code.
    Upgraded to faster code.
    Added stereo support.
    Put in old bug fixes from November 1998.
    Default volume changed from 128 to 255.

14  Added extern "C" { for C++ programs.
    Uploaded 0.6a.


February 1999
--------------

24  Changed [un]load_aud to [un]load_aud_stream.

28  Fixed up most "clicks".
    Put in an ugly hack (thank Grzegorz for the name :) to avoid clipping 
    end of streams.
    Added pause_aud() and resume_aud(). 
    Uploaded 0.6b.


March 2000
-----------

19  Minor changes for Allegro 4.0 and Unix.
    K&R'd source code.
    Uploaded 0.7.


April 2000
-----------

20  (jpm) :-
    Added check to make sure fp is not null in get_next_chunk
    Wrote load_aud_stream_offset, made load_aud_stream into a wrapper
    Added load_aud_stream_offset to audlib.h
    
30  (jpm) :-
    Doubled default buffer size
    Modified load_aud_stream_offset to store offset in new global ofs
    Rewrote restart_aud() to be slightly more intelligent


May 2000
---------

8   (jpm) Now uses new globals datapos and dataend to look for end-of-stream
    instead of pack_feof()
   
10  Merged in JPM's changes, with a few variable name changes.
    Uploaded 0.8.
    

November 2000
--------------

15  Changed function and variable names (e.g. `restart_aud' to
    `restart_aud_stream') to reduce confusion between AUDlib and loadaud.
    Got rid of some useless things (e.g. aud_desc).
    Uploaded 0.9.


January 2002
-------------

03  Changed licence to zlib.
