My WISHLIST.  i.e. exercises left for the reader. :)

Some thing I described in email:


    AUD_STREAM *song1 = load_aud_stream("normal.aud");
    AUD_STREAM *song2 = load_aud_stream("action.aud");

    play_aud_stream(song1);

    while (!game_over) {

	poll_aud();

	if (moodswitch == fast)
	    switch_aud_stream(song2);
	else if (moodswitch == slow)
	    switch_aud_stream(song1);
    }


Conclusion: CBF.

Something else I described in email:

    queue_aud_stream("file1.aud");
    queue_aud_stream("file2.aud");

These would play in sequence.  This would be hard to mix with the 
switch_aud_stream idea, so this basically will be scrapped for the
previous idea.

Maybe more, I forget.
