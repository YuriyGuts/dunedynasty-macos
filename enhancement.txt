Bug/error fixes
---------------
- Fixed the "Frigate arrival in T-0" Starport bug.
- The numbers of units in stock at the Starport that are defined in
    each mission are now used correctly.
- Fixed a bug that sometimes caused Carryalls that drop scripted
    reinforcements to get stuck at the border of the map.
- Fixed a small graphical glitch on the Atreides Mentat screen.
- Fixed a broken frame in the Gun Turret animation.
- The corners of the map are no longer revealed from shroud at the
    beginning of the mission.
- Fixed some minor errors in briefing texts.


Gameplay changes
----------------
- The AI now rebuilds destroyed structures more actively and frequently.
- Building repair cost has been reduced.

- Palace repairs now cost nothing. This is actually a bug, read more here.
    *** Fixed: palace repairs now cost 2 per tick.

- The maximum overall number of buildings that can be present on the
    map reduced from 81 to 80.
- The player can now build concrete slabs and wall segments even if
    the building-per-map limit is reached.
- The saboteur is now visible to the player.

- The maximum number of saboteurs that can be present on the map at
    any given time reduced from 3 to 2.
    *** Reverted this change.

- Ornithopter hit points increased from 10 to 25.
- Troopers and Launchers are now able to fire at air units.

- The maximum number of Sandworms that can be present on the map at a
    time reduced from 3 to 2.
    *** Reverted this change.

- The number of units a Sandworm will swallow before disappearing
    reduced from 4 to 3.
- Fremen units and Sandworms are no longer ignored by turrets.


Interface changes
-----------------
- The "Repair" button on the sidebar now starts flashing red when a
    building is below 50% its original HP.
- Most unit orders can now be correctly issued from keyboard by
    pressing the first letter of the corresponding order's name.

- Pressing the "A" key no longer can be used to issue a "Harvest"
    order to a Harvester.
    *** Reverted since "H" is now a shortcut for construction yard.

- Pressing the "G" key now orders a combat unit to guard.
- Pressing the "H" key no longer orders a combat unit to retreat.
- The wormsign is now announced for the Atreides player.


Miscellaneous
-------------
- Added two more player ranks ("Chief Warlord" and "Emperor") to the
    scoring system.
- The Fremen colour scheme has been made a bit brighter.
- Removed several animation frames of the Heavy Factory, Repair
    Facility and High-Tech Factory.

- Removed two Mentat database entries: "Sardaukar" and "Frigate".
    *** Restored the English text.

- Certain characters from the 6p font (used on the game sidebar) have
    been narrowed down by 1 pixel.  These include C, E, F and L.


==================================================================
==      OpenDUNE: Enhancement over Dune 2                       ==
==================================================================

When OpenDUNE is started in enhanced mode (default), a lot of bugs and
 problems which are in the original Dune2 version, are fixed.

Below is the complete listing of all those bugs and problems, per category.
 Every entry describes the problem, where the solution is in all cases
 obvious by the way the problem is described and therefore the solution is
 not mentioned as such.


Structure
---------
- When building a Wall, the owner-bits are not cleared correctly, which in
    theory could mean a Wall build by you could show up as owned by Sadukar.
- When building a structure completely on slabs, it still degrades. This seems
    in contrast with the idea of slabs.
- When building a structure, only the fog is removed (with a radius of 2) from
    the first tile defined in the layout of the structure. This is mostly
    noticable with Palace and Oil Refinery, leaving parts of them in the fog.
- Windtraps that have less than 50% hp still produce 50% of the power, even so
    the GUI tells you differently. Of course the GUI makes more sense in this
    case.

- Repair cost calculation is unfair. Dune2 uses a 256 float-resolution,
    meaning that you get rounding errors very fast. In result, Palace costs
    nothing to repair, and a windtrap costs 2 credits instead of 3 credits per
    repair tick. In detail: ((2 * 256 / hitpoints) * credits + 128) / 256. The
    first part causes rounding errors.
    *** Reverted this change, with fix for palaces.

- If one structure gives a script error, all structures after it in the linked
    list are not handled. This doesn't really seem correct.
- In Script function which finds the closest unit to target, it doesn't pick
    the closest unit within range, but the one with the highest index within
    range.
- Too many tile colours are remapped with house colours, causing graphical
    issues with the IX building. It maps 0x90 .. 0xA0 instead of 0x90 .. 0x96.
- When taking over a building (by having an infantry walk in it while the
    structure is on low hitpoints), your own units keep firing at it, and will
    most likely destroy it.
- When you attack the structure of the AI, the idea is that they massively
    start to attack you (payback and stuff). To do this, Dune2 searches all
    Units with type 0 (Carry-alls), instead of type 0xFFFF (all units).
    WARNING: this glitch makes the game much easier in its original form.
- A structure in production also counts towards your storable spice,
    producing power, and/or requiring power. It does not check if the structure
    is in fact placed on the map.
- If a structure gets damaged during upgrading, pressing the "Upgrading" button
    silently starts the repair of the structure, and doesn't cancel upgrading.
- Fog is removed around the top left corner instead of the center of a
    structure.


Unit
----
- Once a Unit enters a tile on which it starts to wobble, it will never stop
    wobbling, even if it enters a tile where it shouldn't wobble.
- When a Unit enters a Structure, the last tile the Unit was on becomes
    selected rather than the entire Structure.
- Deviated units always belong to Ordos, no matter who did the deviating.
- Saboteurs tend to forget their goal, depending on terrain and game speed:
    to blow up on reaching their destination.


Scenario
--------
- A mistake in reading the '+' causes repeat for reinforcements to be always
    false. In result reinforcement is only send once.

- The structure '% hitpoints' is ignored. In result all structures always
    have 100% hitpoints.
    *** Reverted this change.


House
-----
- When you have a refinery and lost all your harvesters, you get a new one even
    if you are currently building one in heavy vehicle factory.
- Silo credit capping is done outside the main house loop, causing it to only
    update the house which owns the latest structure. This allows you to go
    over your silo capacity most of the time, and then losing it all of a
    sudden (when you start building a structure).


Teams
-----
- If a team gives a script error, all other teams are aborted.


SaveLoad
--------
- The save routine allowed a NAME chunk up to 65536 bytes, where 255 bytes
    should be sufficient for any sane name (both excluding the \0).


General
-------
- The screen telling if you have the security question wrong/right is there
    for such short time, you never really see it.
- When loading a game, the fadein is barely visible because it is against the
    screen how it will turn out, minus the selection of an active building.
- After visiting Mentat (the help) window, auto-repeat of keys gets disabled.
- Dune2 depends on slow CPUs to limit the rate mouse clicks are handled.


Map
---
- When a unit moves over the top of a mound, you never get abandoned vehicles
    nor hiding enemy units
- When getting free Trikes on the map, you never got ownership of them. The
    parameter order is switched, where the type of the unit becomes the number
    of the house, and the house becomes the value of Trike (13). This also
    means that these vehicles read/write outside the house struct, which in
    terms results in random artifects.


==================================================================
==      Dune Dynasty Enhancements                               ==
==================================================================

Many of the fixes to the scenario files from the "v1.07 fix" patch
have been incorporated.  (Bugs are fixed in the code.)

Gameplay fixes
--------------
- Fixed the internal syntax error which prevented the AI from
    assembling attack teams of vehicles ("team bug").

- Looped reinforcements are now enabled in certain missions.
    *** This is enabled by OpenDUNE.

[n] Remove the Gun Turret's ability to fire at Carryalls (happens in the
    EU version of Dune II, and also in the Sega Mega Drive version).
    *** See: http://forum.dune2k.com/topic/20490-dune-2-scenario-format/page__st__40

- Fix the bug with the Saboteur occasionally detonating when ordered
    to move to a rock cell immediately adjacent to the rock/sand border.
- Fix the bug that happens sometimes when a Saboteur is destroyed, it
    somehow leaves a "trace" on the map: a green dot is still shown on
    the minimap, and the tile itself can not be built upon or occupied
    by other units.
- Perhaps it is a good idea to disable the AI's ability to place its
    rebuilt structures over the player's buildings.


Glitches and improvement suggestions
------------------------------------
- Fix the graphical glitch with large sprites that cuts the top part
    of a units' image.

- Use the special Fremen and Sardaukar Trooper sidebar icons.
    *** Note: makes deviated Fremen and Sardaukar distinguishable.

[n] Maybe also double the Fremen Troopers' hit points compared to the
    regular Troopers, as in the Sega version.

- Add the "infantry squad remains" tile to the situation when an
    infantry/trooper squad spawns a single soldier/trooper, like in
    the Sega version.

[n] Add a proper follow (escort) mode (in Dune II, a unit will only
    follow another unit until either of the units stops moving).
    *** Units on escort mode don't fire, potential source of confusion.

[n] Make ground vehicles' shadows transparent, like the air units' shadows.
    *** Shadows are drawn into the original sprites.

- Restore unused speech clips and sound effects.
- Restore the "special bloom" map feature.

- If you start building up your base, build a Windtrap and start
   building a Refinery, then save your game and load it, you're very
   likely to lose all your credits before the Refinery is completed,
   making further progress impossible.
   *** Fixed by OpenDUNE.

- If you have no buildings at the start, but only an MCV, you lose all
    your money when deploying the MCV.


Mission-specific fixes
----------------------
- Fixed invalid spice bloom placement in SCENA005.
- Fixed the error that disabled Devastator reinforcements.

- Fixed incorrect hit point values for pre-placed buildings in SCENH006.
    *** Note that, by default, structure hit points are ignored.

[n] Changed the player's starting credits from 1500 to 1000 in SCENO022.
    *** Could be justified by saying Ordos is a wealthy house.  Use
    MrFlibble's fixed scenarios if desired (harder Ordos campaign).

[n] Changed Atreides Troopers to Atreides Infantry.
    *** Doesn't really hurt, but maybe they should be Fremen?

- Changed the Atreides WOR to Atreides Barracks, so that the Atreides
    can produce infantry.
- Fixed all missions where the MaxUnit value name was misspelled as
    MaxUnits for an AI player.
- Fixed the error which prevented the player from buying Ornithopters
    at the Starport.


Mentat information and spelling fixes
-------------------------------------
- Fixed incorrect power consumption values for the Barracks and the
    Starport.

- Removed two obsolete entries in German from the English Mentat database.
    *** Restored the English text for the Sardaukar and Frigate entries.

- Fixed the spelling of the word "Ornithopter".
- Fixed the spelling of the word "incompatible".
- Fixed the spelling of the word "Starport" in the building hints section.
- Fixed Harkonnen mentat description for Devastator.
- Fixed Harkonnen mentat description for Siege tank.
- Fixed Ordos mentat description for Ornithopter.
